--- abstract

This document defines the Digest and Want-Digest header fields for HTTP, thus allowing client
 and server to negotiate an integrity checksum of the exchanged resource representation data.

This document obsoletes [RFC3230]. It replaces the term "instance" with "representation",
which makes it consistent  with the HTTP Semantic and Context defined in [RFC7231].

# Introduction

Integrity protection for HTTP content is multi layered and
is usually achieved across the protocol stack:
TCP checksums and TLS record to name but some.

The HTTP protocol does not provide means to protect the various
message parts. Besides, it might be desirable to add additional guarantees
to the ones provided by the transport layer (eg. HTTPS). This may be in order to:

- detect programming errors and corruption of stored data;
- address the need for the representation-data to remain unmodified throughout multiple hops;
- implement signature mechanisms that cover the desired parts of an HTTP exchange;
- provide additional protection against failures or attack (see [SRI]).

## Brief history of integrity headers

The Content-MD5 header field was originally introduced to provide integrity,
but HTTP/1.1  [RFC7231] in appendix-B obsoleted it:

  > The Content-MD5 header field has been removed because it was
  >  inconsistently implemented with respect to partial responses.

[RFC3230] provided a more flexible solution introducing the concept of "instance",
and the headers `Digest` and `Want-Digest`.

## This proposal

The concept of `selected representation` defined in [RFC7231] made [RFC3230] definitions
inconsistent with the current standard. A refresh was then required.

This document updates the `Digest` and `Want-Digest` header field definitions to align with [RFC7231] concepts.

This approach can be easily adapted to use-cases where the transferred data
does require some sort of manipulation to be considered a representation
or conveys a partial representation of a resource (eg. Range Requests).

Changes are semantically compatible with existing implementations
and better cover both the request and response cases.

The value of `Digest` is calculated on selected representation,
which is tied to the value contained in any `Content-Encoding` or `Content-Type` header fields.
Therefore, a given resource may have multiple different digest values.

To allow both parties to exchange a Digest of a representation
with [no content codings](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-3.1.2.1)
two more algorithms are added (`ID-SHA-256` and `ID-SHA-512`).

## Goals

The goals of this proposal are:

   1. Digest coverage for either the resource's `representation data` or `selected representation data`
      communicated via HTTP.

   2. Support for multiple digest algorithms.

   3. Negotiation of the use of digests.

The goals do not include:

  Header integrity:
  : The digest mechanisms described here cover only representation and selected representation data,
    and do not protect the integrity of associated
    representation metadata headers or other message headers.

  Authentication:
  : The digest mechanisms described here are not meant to support
    authentication of the source of a digest or of a message or
    anything else.  These mechanisms, therefore, are not a sufficient
    defense against many kinds of malicious attacks.

  Privacy:
  : Digest mechanisms do not provide message privacy.

  Authorization:
  : The digest mechanisms described here are not meant to support
    authorization or other kinds of access controls.


## Notational Conventions
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 ([RFC2119] and [RFC8174])
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

The definitions "representation", "selected representation", "representation data",
"representation metadata" and "payload body" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in [RFC7230] and [RFC7231].


# Resource representation and representation-data {#resource-representation}

To avoid inconsistencies, an integrity mechanism for http messages
should decouple the checksum calculation:

- from the payload body - which may be altered by mechanism like Range Requests or the method (eg. HEAD);

- and from the message body - which depends on `Transfer-Encoding` and whatever tranformations
the intermediaries may apply.

The following examples shows how representation metadata, payload tranformations and method
impacts on the message and payload body.

Here is a gzip-compressed json object

~~~
Request:

    PUT /entries/1234 HTTP/1.1
    Content-Type: application/json
    Content-Encoding: gzip

    H4sIAItWyFwC/6tWSlSyUlAypANQqgUAREcqfG0AAAA=

~~~

Now the same payload body conveys a malformed json object.

~~~
Request:

    PUT /entries/1234 HTTP/1.1
    Content-Type: application/json

    H4sIAItWyFwC/6tWSlSyUlAypANQqgUAREcqfG0AAAA=

~~~

A Range-Request alters the payload body, conveying a partial representation.

~~~
Request:

    GET /entries/1234 HTTP/1.1
    Range: bytes=1-7

Response:

    HTTP/1.1 206 Partial Content
    Content-Encoding: gzip
    Content-Type: application/json
    Content-Range: bytes=1-7

    iwgAla3RXA==
~~~


Now the method too alters the payload body.

~~~
Request:

    HEAD /entries/1234 HTTP/1.1
    Accept: application/json
    Accept-Encoding: gzip

Response:

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json
    Content-Encoding: gzip

~~~


# Digest Algorithm values {#algorithms}

   Digest algorithm values are used to indicate a specific digest
   computation.  For some algorithms, one or more parameters may be
   supplied.

~~~
      digest-algorithm = token
~~~

   The BNF for "parameter" is as is used in [RFC7230].
   All digest-algorithm values are case-insensitive.


   The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) acts as a registry for
   digest-algorithm values.  The registry contains the
   following tokens.


  SHA-256:
  : The SHA-256 algorithm [FIPS180-3].  The output of
    this algorithm is encoded using the base64 encoding [RFC4648].

    Reference: [FIPS180-3], [RFC4648], this document.

  SHA-512:
  : The SHA-512 algorithm [FIPS180-3].  The output of
    this algorithm is encoded using the base64 encoding [RFC4648].

    Reference: [FIPS180-3], [RFC4648], this document.

  MD5:
  : The MD5 algorithm, as specified in [RFC1321].
    The output of this algorithm is encoded using the
    base64 encoding  [RFC4648].

  SHA:
  : The SHA-1 algorithm [FIPS180-1].  The output of this
    algorithm is encoded using the base64 encoding  [RFC4648].

  UNIXsum:
  : The algorithm computed by the UNIX "sum" command,
    as defined by the Single UNIX Specification,
    Version 2 [UNIX].  The output of this algorithm is an
    ASCII decimal-digit string representing the 16-bit
    checksum, which is the first word of the output of
    the UNIX "sum" command.

  UNIXcksum:
  : The algorithm computed by the UNIX "cksum" command,
    as defined by the Single UNIX Specification,
    Version 2 [UNIX].  The output of this algorithm is an
    ASCII digit string representing the 32-bit CRC,
    which is the first word of the output of the UNIX
    "cksum" command.

To allow sender and recipient to provide a checksum which is independent from the Content-Coding,
the following additional algorithms are defined:

   ID-SHA-512:
   : The sha-512 digest of the representation-data of the resource when no
     content coding is applied (eg. `Content-Encoding: identity`)

   ID-SHA-256:
   : The sha-256 digest of the representation-data of the resource when no
     content coding is applied (eg. `Content-Encoding: identity`)

   If other digest-algorithm values are defined, the associated encoding
   MUST either be represented as a quoted string, or MUST NOT include
   ";" or "," in the character sets used for the encoding.

## Representation digest {#representation-digest}

A representation  digest is the value of the output of a digest
algorithm, together with an indication of the algorithm used (and any
parameters).

~~~
    representation-data-digest = digest-algorithm "="
                            <encoded digest output>
~~~

As explained in {#resource-representations} the digest
is computed on the entire selected `representation data` of the resource
defined in [RFC7231]:

~~~
  representation-data := Content-Encoding( Content-Type( bits ) )
~~~


The encoded digest output uses the encoding format defined for the
specific digest-algorithm.

### digest-algorithm encoding examples

The `sha-256` digest-algorithm uses base64 encoding.
Note that digest-algoritm values are case insensitive.


~~~
sha-256=X48E9qOokqqrvdts8nOJRJN3OWDUoyWxBf7kbu9DBPE=
~~~

The "UNIXsum" digest-algorithm uses ASCII string of decimal digits.

~~~
UNIXsum=30637
~~~

# Header Specifications

The following headers are defined

## Want-Digest {#want-digest-header}

The Want-Digest message header field indicates the sender's desire to
receive a representation digest on messages associated with the Request-
URI and representation metadata.

    Want-Digest = "Want-Digest" ":"
                     #(digest-algorithm [ ";" "q" "=" qvalue])

If a digest-algorithm is not accompanied by a qvalue, it is treated
as if its associated qvalue were 1.0.

The sender is willing to accept a digest-algorithm if and only if it
is listed in a Want-Digest header field of a message, and its qvalue
is non-zero.

If multiple acceptable digest-algorithm values are given, the
sender's preferred digest-algorithm is the one (or ones) with the
highest qvalue.

Examples:

   Want-Digest: sha-256
   Want-Digest: SHA-256;q=0.3, sha;q=1

## Digest {#digest-header}

The Digest header field provides a digest of the representation data

~~~
      Digest = "Digest" ":" #(representation-data-digest)
~~~

`Representation data` might be:

- fully contained in the message body,
- partially-contained in the message body,
- or not at all contained in the message body.

The resource is specified by the effective
Request-URI and any cache-validator contained in the message.

For example, in a response to a HEAD request, the digest is calculated using  the
representation data that would have been enclosed in the payload body
if the same request had been a GET.

Digest can be used in requests too.
Returned value depends on the representation metadata headers.

A Digest header field MAY contain multiple representation-data-digest values.
This could be useful for responses expected to reside in caches
shared by users with different browsers, for example.

A recipient MAY ignore any or all of the representation-data-digests in a Digest
header field.

A sender MAY send a representation-data-digest using a digest-algorithm without
knowing whether the recipient supports the digest-algorithm, or even
knowing that the recipient will ignore it.

# Deprecate Negotiation of Content-MD5
This RFC deprecates the negotiation of Content-MD5 as
this header has been obsoleted by [RFC7231]

The MD5 algorithm is NOT RECOMMENDED as it's now vulnerable
to collision attacks [CMU-836068]

# Examples


## Unsolicited Digest response

### Representation data is fully contained in the payload

  {"hello": "world"}
~~~

###  Representation data is not contained in the payload

~~~
Request:

  HEAD /items/123

Response:

  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  Content-Type: application/json
  Content-Encoding: identity
  Digest: sha-256=X48E9qOokqqrvdts8nOJRJN3OWDUoyWxBf7kbu9DBPE=

~~~

###  Representation data is partially contained in the payload i.e. range request

  "hello"

~~~

### Digest in both Request and Response. Returned value depends on representation metadata

Digest can be used in requests too. Returned value depends on the representation metadata headers.

~~~
Request:

  PUT /items/123
  Content-Type: application/json
  Content-Encoding: identity
  Accept-Encoding: br
  Digest: sha-256=4REjxQ4yrqUVicfSKYNO/cF9zNj5ANbzgDZt3/h3Qxo=

  {"hello": "world"}

Response:

  Content-Type: application/json
  Content-Encoding: br
  Digest: sha-256=X48E9qOokqqrvdts8nOJRJN3OWDUoyWxBf7kbu9DBPE=

  b'\x8b\x08\x80{"hello": "world"}\x03'

~~~

## Want-Digest solicited digest responses

### Client request data is fully contained in the payload

The client requests a digest, preferring sha. The server is free to reply with sha-256 anyway.

~~~
Request:

  GET /items/123
  Want-Digest: sha-256;q=0.3, sha;q=1

Response:

  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  Content-Type: application/json
  Content-Encoding: identity
  Digest: sha-256=X48E9qOokqqrvdts8nOJRJN3OWDUoyWxBf7kbu9DBPE=

  {"hello": "world"}
~~~

###  A client requests an unsupported Digest, the server MAY reply with an unsupported digest

The client requests a sha digest only. The server is currently free to reply with a Digest containing an unsupported algorithm

~~~
Request:

  GET /items/123
  Want-Digest: sha;q=1

Response:

  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  Content-Type: application/json
  Content-Encoding: identity
  Digest: sha-256=X48E9qOokqqrvdts8nOJRJN3OWDUoyWxBf7kbu9DBPE=

  {"hello": "world"}
~~~

### A client requests an unsupported Digest, the server MAY reply with a 400

The client requests a sha Digest, the server advises for sha-256 and sha-512

~~~
Request:

  GET /items/123
  Want-Digest: sha;q=1

Response:

  HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
  Want-Digest: sha-256, sha-512
~~~

# Security Considerations

## Usage in signatures

Digital signatures are widely used together with checksums to provide
the certain identification of the origin of a message [NIST800-32].

It's important to note that, being the Digest header an hash of a resource representation,
signing only the `Digest` header, without all the representation metatada (eg.
the values of `Content-Type` and `Content-Encoding`) may expose the communication
to tampering.

# Acknowledgements

The vast majority of this document is inherited from [RFC3230], so thanks
to J. Mogul and A. Van Hoff for their great work.
The original idea of refreshing this document arose from an interesting
discussion with M. Nottingham, J. Yasskin and M. Thomson when reviewing
the MICE Content Encoding.


# FAQ

1. Why remove all references to content-md5?

   Those were unnecessary to understanding and using this spec.

2. Why remove references to instance manipulation?

   Those were unnecessary for correctly using and applying the spec. An
   example with Range Request is more than enough. This doc uses the term
   "partial representation" which should group all those cases.

3. How to use `Digest` with `PATCH` method?

   The PATCH verb brings some complexities (eg. about representation metadata headers, patch document format, ...),

   - PATCH entity-headers apply to the patch document and MUST NOT be applied to the target resource,
     see [RFC5789], Section 2.
   - servers shouldn't assume PATCH semantics for generic media types like "application/json" but should
     instead use a proper content-type, eg [RFC7396]
   - a `200 OK` response to a PATCH request would contain the digest of the patched item, and the etag of the new object.
     This behavior - tighly coupled to the application logic - gives the client low probability of guessing the actual
     outcome of this operation (eg. concurrent changes, ...)
     
4. Why remove references to delta-encoding?

   Unnecessary for a correct implementation of this spec. The revised spec can be nicely adapted
   to "delta encoding", but all the references here to delta encoding don't add anything to this RFC.
   Another job would be to refresh delta encoding.
   
5. Why remove references to Digest Authentication?

   This RFC seems to me completely unrelated to Digest Authentication but for the word "Digest".

6. What changes in `Want-Digest`?

   We allow to use the `Want-Digest` in responses to advertise the supported digest-algorithms
   and the inability to accept requests with unsupported digest-algorithms.

7. Does this spec changes supported algorithms?

   This RFC updates [RFC5843] which is still delegated for all algorithms updates,
   and adds two more algorithms: ID-SHA-256 and ID-SHA-512 which allows to
   send a checksum of a resource representation with no content codings applied.
