Doing so will cause interoperability issues,\r\n   because the semantics of PATCH become specific to that resource,\r\n   rather than general.\r\n3- it's difficult to use patch + checksums, like @LPardue said\r\n\r\n## Hypothesis\r\n\r\n1- warn people about PATCH+Digest\r\n2- don't forbid PATCH+Digest"
