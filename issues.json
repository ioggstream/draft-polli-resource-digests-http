Some options include:\r\n\r\n* To detect message corruption. This is the only reason I can think of to use the ADLER32, CRC32c, MD5, SHA, UNIXsum, or UNIXcksum algorithms, but I think it's unnecessary with modern transport protocols?\r\n* To support signatures, for example in [Signed Exchanges](https://github.com/WICG/webpackage).\r\n* To give the client a hint about which SRI hash will be used, to maybe help with https://github.com/w3c/preload/issues/127.\r\n\r\nAre there others? If those are the only ones, and message corruption isn't needed anymore, we could deprecate all the non-cryptographic digest algorithms."

Doing so will cause interoperability issues,\r\n   because the semantics of PATCH become specific to that resource,\r\n   rather than general.\r\n3- it's difficult to use patch + checksums, like @LPardue said\r\n\r\n## Hypothesis\r\n\r\n1- warn people about PATCH+Digest\r\n2- don't forbid PATCH+Digest"
